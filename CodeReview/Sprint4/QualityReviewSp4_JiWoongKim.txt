What is Readable:
- It is easy to detect abstract picture only with code basis, because the initial point is set as (0,0)
- naming for variables are very straightforward and easy to understand

What is NOT Readable:
- As it is mentioned by the author, the magic number would be better to be changed even if the game being implemented 
is 2 dimensional basis.
-createTranslation comment for explanation would be helpful for other reveiwers.

Minutes taken: 20

Specific comments on code quality:
Naming: Good
 All the name for methods and variables are straighforward and easy to understand 

Logic: Good
 The code is well organized and written without redundant code for maniplating display for G  ame.
The only recommendation for this class is, since there are some if statement in here, in order to
maxizmize the effiecieny of runnig time, short circuit rule might be used. Depending on predicting 
the high probability among the if statement condition, it would work for maxizming the code effieciency.
