What is Readable:
- The Method name is easy to understand. Also, the variables name is easy to understand.
-The logic is clear and the structure is easy.
-The property is clear and apporitate.

What is NOT Readable:
- The order of each methods can be changed to make more easider to read.
-Some method like IsGoomba, IsKoopa looks not the best way to go. It may be change to enmus and some other method
It would be better.
-Plug Physics, if the physics class can be sigleton, it structure will looks good.
-Some physics method are used in state classes. May be for refractory, we can make them consist.

Overall. The function of the enemy abstract is not bad, it implement many features and make the files looks good.
However, some suggestion to the file is that the structure can be better baed on the physics. So I think, after we 
finished our refractory part, we can fix it well.

I think, we need more to imporove and make the class looks better.
