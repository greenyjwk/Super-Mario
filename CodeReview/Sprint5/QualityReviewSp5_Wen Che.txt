Specific comments on code quality:
The file keeps it's good part and it changes some little part based on the eariler suggestion.
It doesn't have any magic number in there and it doesn't contains any warning. 
It also doesn't have the quick fixed in there anymore.
All the methods keep focusing on what it should do and nothing else,
and the name is good: all the name is clear and be able to show what it contians.

This class is not using a lot but it's a nice example for me if I want to add some new feature into
the game. The class is clean and short with no too-long sentence nor too-long methods.
