Specific comments on code quality:
Naming: Good
- Naming is sometimes the issue we need to take care of, since we usually just make a easy name 
for variables to test and forgot to change it. This file is a good example of how we should 
name each variables and methods. I would like to see this type of naming all across our project.
All the methods are having their name showing what it does and the variable's name is also clear.
 
However, I would recommend having all the things that are using {get;set} to start with upper
case. That's the small naming rules we sometimes forget.

Explaining and doing what the class should do: Good
-The logic in the methods here is clear and simple. The methods only deals with one goals and
the class is clean. But, there are some quick fixed codes( throw new NotImplementedException) and
there should be some better way to fix that. Having methods like "IsAssignable" would helps.
