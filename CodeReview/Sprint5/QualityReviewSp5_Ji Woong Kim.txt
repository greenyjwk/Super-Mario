Specific comments on code quality:
Naming: Good
- The terms are straightforward and they are easy to understand what they stand for. For that reason, It is
easy to understand each field is what does in the class.

Explaining and doing what the class should do: Good
- The class works for output the text on the top of the screen with the infromation in Mario. The logic in drawing
is similar with the draw method in the sprite class. In addition, the fix text controls the lenght of the text
considering the space in the screen by using loop.The tiny recommendation for the the class is that, since the logic 
in draw method is repetitive, put declaration part upward together and put draw process downward together in the signle method would help increase the 
readability.

Naming: Good

- Naming is straigtforward for readers to read and undrstand depending on the text group meaning differnet
information. Since the classification of these group according to the meanig, the readers could read through
more effiicently and easily.


Explaining and doing what the class should do: Good
- The class makes the group the texts depending on the function and position, and then display the each
texts at the appropriate position. The class splits the method depending on the each different method's function,
and the texts get new updtated information after each upadate and then shows up at screen such as the sprite.
