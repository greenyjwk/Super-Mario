Naming: Good
- Naming in this class is good. Since this class is an extention of enemy class, it basically use
the base that from the enemy class, which makes it short and clean and really easy to read. 
The variable, health, is the variable that keeps how many "hit" the mini boss can take. This is a 
name that is really easy to understand what it means and what that variable contains.

Explaining and doing what the class should do: Good
-The logic in the methods here is really clear. The methods that are contained in this class 
are the methods mini boss needed, but not all the methods enemy class has. Although it basically 
override the methods from enemy class, it is still clean and it doesn't have any necessary methods.
Other functions that doesn't need to be in this class are build in separate class that supporting 
this class.

Quality:

Specific comments on code quality:
There is no magic number in this class and it doesn't contains any warning. 
It also doesn't have the quick fixed, the whole class is nicely impelmented.

All the methods keep focusing on what it should do and nothing else, no super long line nor 
long sentence.It is also easy to reuse and easy to add new functions in.
