Specific comments on code quality:
Naming: Good
- Most of naming is straightorward and easy to understand. The clss deals with many things about initiative
part of the game. and it chooses the name which is very highly reltaed depending on the functions it supposed
to do. What I just want to point for tiny revise is, for the CameraMario which is the object for camera interface,
I would say it would be more meaningful term. 
 

Explaining and doing what the class should do: Good
-The class implements the comprehensive game processes about reltive initiative side. The logic in the method 
has high cohesion, and each of them stays on the single fucntion. Considering the materials the class implements,
there are some different various parts for the game process. However, it organiges with timer, soudns and display 
with less complexity. When it comes to performance, it does not cause errors and the point making game slow due to
the logic complexity.
