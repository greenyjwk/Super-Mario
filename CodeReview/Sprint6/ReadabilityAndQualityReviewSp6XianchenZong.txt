Readability:

-Make a new data structure, which contains lots of function, quite easy to understand and clear.

-Several methods inside this data structure, which is to go through the list or change the list, 
each method has a clear name and much easy to understand. It looks professional. 

-Combined several classes that related this data structure, so the readability makes good. 
Looks really like a official data structure kernel methods. It is good.

-Naming the name of each method and each variable is clear and easy to understand, also the 
name of the class, it is really easy to understand.

Over all, the code readability is really good, and it is fantastic to make a new game date 
structure for the list iteration in the collision Detector. 


Quality:

-The Quality is also good. Since it use the kernel method design pattern, the logic is clear and the way to 
call each variable and methods are reasonable. No redundancy.

-Also, the code looks good and the actual function of each method have no redundancy, so it is good on Code quality. 

Overall, the design way it amazing and new to me. Since it use some software knowledge, it is good and really good 
for the collision refractory.
