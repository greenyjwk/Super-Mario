Specific comments on code quality:
The sprite for mario works well, the code are readable and meaningful. The whole work looks good, one thing 
that I should mention is that it is better to delete some code in Draw() class since of our picture
has already been cut well, no need for frame. Above all the code looks good and easy to understand.

Class role :
	Overall, the code looks good. By using the abstract class, it allows the whole code looks 
	clean and concise. Most of the things were put in the abstract class. So it much easier to maintain. 
	So I really like the style. Also, the naming style was cool and good to go. They are all meaningful name, 
	so, they are easy to read the maintenance. So I really like the code style. They are all readable and maintainable.
	There are not too many problems in this .cs file. It is loose coupling and high cohesion. By using abstract, 
	it extracts the Update() and Draw() to abstract classes.
	No duplicated code, no long class and also no long method. So, it is good to refractory.

 Naming:
	The naming work looks also good. I they are meaningful and useful. Each name can reflect its own work in this class,
	So, I like this way to go.
 Additional notes:
    Overall, the whole design of the .cs file is really good, extremely less code smell and it is really good for futher
	project to use.
