Specific comments on code quality:
Naming: Good
- Most of the variables are having reasonable and readable name, it's really easy to tell what that 
variable does and what class does it belongs and lets the reader be able to know 
exactly what the variable represent. Including "Frame", "Sheet" really helps.
The suggestion I would give is to even add the item name into the variable name,
for example, "currentGoombaFrame". However, since it's already in GoombaSprite class,
this might be not useful.
The method name is really good. Simple but clearly shows what each methods are about.

Explaining and doing what the class should do: Good
-As a small class for the Goomba sprite, it only contains the methods that drawing a 
sprite requires. Using abstruct class to help cleaning up the code is a great way to
implement classes. It doesn't have long methods, long class, long line or other code smells 
that I think will leads to a problem. The code make each methods doing only 1 thing and let
the class combines the methods to work together for a single uses. Therefore, I think it 
meets high cohision and low coupling.

Additional notes:
-The current implementation is using an abstruct class, and it's
really easy to using the code elsewhere or changing the Goomba into
some other fetures. The code is highly reuseable and please keep
doing so for other classes.
