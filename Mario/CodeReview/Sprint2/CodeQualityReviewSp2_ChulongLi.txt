Specific comments on code review:
The good structure of Blocks makes her code pretty easy to read, but changing the general variable name into 
detailed variable name, which can show the meaning of this variable, may be better for the further development.
The class has a high quality code while there isn't any redundant method or variable.

Specific comments on code review:
The overall code is excellent and elegant. By using the abstract class BlockState, it could 
remove several general methods, like Update and Draw, significantly reducing the code complexity.
Although some unnecessary using Directive may need to be deleted, they may be used later for 
futher development. In addition to good structure based on effective variables and methods, the 
names of both variables and methods meet the requirement of the C# standard naming rule.
