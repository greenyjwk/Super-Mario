Notes:

- there are several internal instances of ITextSprites that the class uses to function. They are all used similarly. 
This could be refactored using a dictionary and a common method for simplicity, readability, and lower complexity

- this class references many specific instance variables inside of GameObjectManager. It may be best to have the
 GameObjectManager package this information for you, so this code is flexible to changes in the GameObjectManager

- there are several references to a HUDUtil class (assumedly to remove magic numbers). The main purpose of doing so 
is to give meaning to these numbers, but their names ("distance", "timeLength",etc) are not specific enough, and further
may be best imported from a configuration file, so they can be changed easily.

- The formula for placing text seems fit for one window size, perhaps refactor to get window information from the Graphics manager


Hypothetical Change:
- Imagine having to rescale the window size, several of the formulas used to place the HUD elements will not function properly.
- Adding a new kind of HUD element requires much more work than if all the elements were managed similarly.
