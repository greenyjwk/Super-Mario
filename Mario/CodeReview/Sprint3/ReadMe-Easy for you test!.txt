Hey Dean!
Here is some instruction of the test, hope may help you to grade.
1.	Some keys to change Mario state
(1)	Y : Normal Mario
(2)	U: Super Mario
(3)	I: Fire Mario
(4)	O: Dead Mario (Nornam Mario)
(5)	P: Star Mario (Now it is black Mario)

2.	Hidden Block：
We have hidden block, which is one the right of the floor block. There are two hidden blocks. 
Tell me if you cannot find them. They can only be trigged from bottom.

3. Fire and Super Mario comes to enemy
	Since we want the FPS higher, so we cancel the delat, this may make Super and Fire mario more easier to dead. Since it is 
	too sensitive. So, just click the keyboard shortly,and you can find Fire mario and super can back to normal mario when they
	collision with bottom, left and right to the enemies.
