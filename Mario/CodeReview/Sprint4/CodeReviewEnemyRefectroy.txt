What is Readable:
- The Method name is still easy to understand. Also, the variables is really clear, it can tell what it 
is managing from the name.
- It maintains what it does before and make some improvment, now it's more easy to understand.

What is NOT Readable Before:
- The order of each methods is changed and it's easy to read.
It goes from basic methods to enemy's own methods.

-I thought that some method like IsGoomba, IsKoopa looks not the best way to go before, but this
 implementation makes much more sence after we take off all the enums.
-Physics structure looks good now, it only does what it should do, nothing else and nothing less.


Overall, the suggestion I made before are all handled, the class is clear and easy to read,
it doesn't have long line nor long methods, the class itself is not too long and it only take cares about
what it should be tracking. 

For now, the Enemy class looks good.
